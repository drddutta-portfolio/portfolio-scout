# PortfolioAI — Migration Register

Every database migration for PortfolioAI is recorded here **after** it has been
applied and verified against the live dedicated Supabase project.

Rules (from the Database Architecture and Development Rules documents):

1. Inspect the live schema before proposing a change.
2. Propose the bounded migration and get approval.
3. Apply it as a single sequential file in `db/migrations/`.
4. Verify the remote schema, grants, RLS state and policy list.
5. Record the result in the table below, including a rollback note.
6. A migration is never considered applied because it appears in a document.

## Applied migrations

| File | Date applied | Objects | RLS / grants impact | Verified | Rollback note |

| 2026-09-05 | Dedicated Supabase project not yet connected to this Lovable project — no credentials present in the environment, so the live schema could not be inspected. Nothing is assumed to exist. |
